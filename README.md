# focus-ext

A small Chrome extension which times how long you've been since you've stayed on whitelisted sites. 
Gives you points for finishing a focus session organically (pressing the stop button on the stopwatch). Minuses points for breaking your session by accessing a blacklisted site.

Instructions: 
1. Add sites to the blacklist (in background.json) - default is google.com
2. On Chrome, unpack the extension in developer mode.
3. Click extension icon to run.
